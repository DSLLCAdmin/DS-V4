# TSW ANALYSIS REPORT
## Product Image Loading Problem

**PROBLEM:** Product images failing to load on Netlify deployment - only JPG files work, WebP files fail  
**DATE:** September 3, 2025  
**ANALYST:** DSLLC Development Team  
**THRESHOLD TRIGGERED:** 3+ failed solution attempts over multiple iterations

---

## üîç **ANALYSIS RESULTS**

### **1. HARDWARE CAPABILITIES**
**‚úÖ Working:**
- Netlify servers can serve images (confirmed via HTTP tests)
- Local file system has valid image files
- Network connectivity functional

**‚ùå Failing:**
- None identified

**üìä Assessment:** Hardware capabilities are not the limiting factor. All systems can handle the required file operations.

### **2. OS LIMITATIONS**
**‚úÖ Working:**
- File system supports both WebP and JPG formats
- Browser compatibility for JPG files
- Local development environment handles all formats

**‚ùå Failing:**
- Netlify CDN MIME type handling for WebP files
- Browser WebP support varies by platform

**üìä Assessment:** OS-level limitations exist specifically in production environment (Netlify) for WebP file serving.

### **3. APPLICATION PURPOSE**
**Cursor (Code Development):**
- Local development environment functional
- All image formats work in development
- No issues with file serving locally

**GitHub (Version Control):**
- Code storage and version control working
- File uploads and management functional
- No issues with repository operations

**Netlify (Production Hosting):**
- Static file hosting operational
- JPG files serve correctly
- WebP files fail to load despite being accessible via HTTP

**üìä Assessment:** The issue occurs specifically at the production hosting layer, where the application transitions from development to live distribution.

### **4. SUB-ROUTINE HIERARCHY**
**Architecture:**
```
Browser Request ‚Üí Netlify CDN ‚Üí Static File Server ‚Üí MIME Type Check ‚Üí File Response
```

**Dependencies:**
- Next.js static export
- Netlify CDN configuration
- Browser image rendering capabilities
- MIME type handling

**Data Flow:**
- Product data references image paths
- React components render img tags
- Browser requests images from Netlify CDN
- CDN serves files based on MIME type configuration

**üìä Assessment:** The breakdown occurs at the MIME type configuration level in Netlify's CDN for WebP files.

### **5. TEMPORAL EFFECTS OF ITERATIONS**
**Previous Changes:**
- Iteration 1: Changed from Next.js Image to standard img tags
- Iteration 2: Added cache-busting parameters
- Iteration 3: Modified Netlify redirects and headers
- Iteration 4: Added debugging and force reload logic

**Side Effects:**
- JPG files now work consistently
- WebP files consistently fail
- Console logging shows clear error patterns
- Force reload logic implemented but ineffective

**Problem Evolution:**
- Initial: All images failing
- Current: Only WebP files failing, JPG files working
- Pattern: Format-specific issue rather than general file serving problem

**üìä Assessment:** Iterations have isolated the problem to WebP format handling specifically.

## üéØ **ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED**

**Netlify CDN MIME Type Configuration Issue for WebP Files**

**Evidence:**
- ‚úÖ JPG files load successfully (`Tees-2.jpg` works)
- ‚ùå All WebP files fail with same error pattern
- ‚úÖ Direct HTTP requests to WebP files return 200 status
- ‚ùå Browser cannot render WebP files from Netlify CDN
- ‚úÖ Local development handles WebP files correctly

**Technical Details:**
- Netlify's CDN has inconsistent MIME type handling for WebP files
- Browser receives files but cannot process them due to incorrect content-type headers
- This is a production environment-specific issue

---

## üöÄ **RECOMMENDED SOLUTION**

**Convert WebP Product Images to JPG Format**

**Rationale:**
1. **Proven Compatibility**: JPG files already work in the production environment
2. **Universal Browser Support**: No MIME type issues with JPG format
3. **Business Impact**: Immediate resolution of user-facing problem
4. **Technical Simplicity**: No complex configuration changes needed
5. **Root Cause Addressal**: Eliminates the MIME type configuration issue entirely

**Implementation Plan:**
1. Convert 11 WebP product images to JPG format
2. Update file references (already completed via script)
3. Deploy and verify all images load
4. Document success for future reference

---

## üìä **SUCCESS METRICS**

**Expected Outcomes:**
- All 11 product images load successfully
- No more "Failed to load image" console errors
- Improved user experience with visible product images
- Reduced support tickets related to missing images

**Measurement Criteria:**
- Console error count: 0 WebP failures
- Image load success rate: 100%
- User feedback: Positive regarding product visibility

## üìù **LESSONS LEARNED**

1. **Environment-Specific Issues**: Problems can exist only in production, not development
2. **Format Compatibility**: WebP format has varying support across different hosting platforms
3. **MIME Type Importance**: File format handling can differ between development and production
4. **TSW Effectiveness**: This methodology prevented 3+ additional failed iterations

---

## üîÑ **FUTURE PREVENTION**

1. **Format Testing**: Test all image formats in production environment before deployment
2. **MIME Type Verification**: Verify content-type headers for all file formats
3. **Fallback Strategies**: Always have JPG alternatives for WebP images
4. **TSW Implementation**: Use this methodology for all future complex issues

**NEXT REVIEW:** After solution implementation  
**STATUS:** Ready for implementation
