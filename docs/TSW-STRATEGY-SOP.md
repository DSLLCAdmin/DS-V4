# TSW (Three-Strike Warning) Strategy SOP
## DSLLC Standard Operating Procedure

**Document Version:** 1.0  
**Effective Date:** September 3, 2025  
**Approved By:** DSLLC Development Team  
**Last Updated:** September 3, 2025

---

## üéØ **PURPOSE**

The TSW Strategy is a systematic problem-solving methodology designed to prevent endless iteration cycles and ensure root cause analysis rather than symptom treatment. This SOP establishes a mandatory review process when three solution attempts fail to resolve a technical issue.

---

## üìã **THRESHOLD TRIGGER**

**AUTOMATIC TSW ANALYSIS REQUIRED WHEN:**
- 3 failed solution attempts on the same problem
- Multiple iterations producing similar results
- Problem persists despite different approaches
- Time investment exceeds 30 minutes on single issue

**MANDATORY STOP:** When threshold is reached, **STOP** all further solution attempts and implement TSW analysis.

---

## üîç **TSW ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK**

### **1. HARDWARE CAPABILITIES**
**Questions to Answer:**
- What system resources are available?
- Are there network/storage limitations?
- What are the physical constraints?
- Are there performance bottlenecks?

**Analysis Points:**
- CPU, RAM, storage capacity
- Network bandwidth and latency
- Hardware compatibility issues
- Resource allocation problems

### **2. OS LIMITATIONS**
**Questions to Answer:**
- What platform constraints exist?
- Are there file system restrictions?
- What permission/security limitations apply?
- Are there OS-specific behaviors?

**Analysis Points:**
- Operating system version and capabilities
- File system permissions and restrictions
- Platform-specific configurations
- Security policy limitations

### **3. APPLICATION PURPOSE**
**Questions to Answer:**
- What is the business requirement?
- What are the user expectations?
- What is the intended functionality?
- How does this fit the overall system?

**Analysis Points:**
- **Cursor (Code Development)**: Local development environment
- **GitHub (Version Control)**: Code storage and collaboration
- **Netlify (Production Hosting)**: Live deployment and distribution
- Business logic and user requirements

### **4. SUB-ROUTINE HIERARCHY**
**Questions to Answer:**
- What is the code architecture?
- What are the dependencies?
- How does data flow through the system?
- Where are the integration points?

**Analysis Points:**
- Code structure and dependencies
- Data flow and processing pipeline
- Integration points and APIs
- Error handling and logging

### **5. TEMPORAL EFFECTS OF ITERATIONS**
**Questions to Answer:**
- How have previous attempts changed the system?
- What state changes occurred?
- What side effects were introduced?
- How has the problem evolved?

**Analysis Points:**
- Changes made in previous iterations
- System state modifications
- Introduced side effects
- Problem evolution over time

## üöÄ **IMPLEMENTATION PROCESS**

### **STEP 1: TRIGGER RECOGNITION**
- Monitor solution attempts
- Count iterations
- Identify when threshold is reached
- **STOP** all further attempts

### **STEP 2: TSW ANALYSIS**
- Complete all 5 framework sections
- Document findings thoroughly
- Identify root cause
- Propose solution with rationale

### **STEP 3: SOLUTION VALIDATION**
- Verify solution addresses root cause
- Confirm no new side effects introduced
- Test in controlled environment
- Document results

### **STEP 4: IMPLEMENTATION**
- Execute approved solution
- Monitor for success
- Document lessons learned
- Update SOP if needed
